In this project, a new martyrsâ€™ data structure using Doubly and Single Linkedlists is implemented. For a good user experience, a graphical user interface (GUI) using javaFX is implemented. When running the project, at first, the user has to load the martyrs file using a file chooser. Then to load Districts in a Doubly Linkedlist, every district has a Single Linkedlist of loactions, every location has a Single Linkedlist of martyrs.
